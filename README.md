Unblocking project

The unblocker project aims to create a process to facilitatite conversations with people who are blocked to help
them become unblocked.

The process includes Facilitators, and people who are blocked (called 'Tom'). The process involves a conversation,
which can result in:

- Better understanding of Tom's motivations in relation to his block.
- Tools to help Tom get unblocked.
- Connections in a social network to help Tom become unblocked.
